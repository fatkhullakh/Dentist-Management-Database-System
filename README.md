# Dentist-Management-Database-System
A database system for dental clinics to manage patients, appointments, payments, and services efficiently.



This project is a database system for dental clinics to manage patients, appointments, payments, and services efficiently. It includes files like CREATE.sql for schema creation, INSERT.sql for sample data, and DROP.sql for schema removal. The system focuses on patient management, appointment scheduling, payment tracking, and service catalog maintenance. It assumes accurate data entry and static pricing, with a single-clinic focus. Future improvements could include multi-clinic support and dynamic pricing. ER diagrams (Diagram.png, FINAL.png) and documentation (Databases.pdf) provide additional details.
